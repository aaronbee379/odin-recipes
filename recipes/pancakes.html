        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Dakota Kelly from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allrecipes.com</a> found this pancake recipe from her Grandmother's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of the recipe card, it was a family favorite.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
